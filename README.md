# Player-ReIdentification-Using-YOLO-DeepSort


---

## 📋 Overview

This project demos a simple real-time pipeline that:

1. Loads a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model to detect players (and the ball).  
2. Uses DeepSORT to assign and maintain consistent IDs as players exit/re-enter the frame.  
3. Writes out a tracked video showing each player’s bounding box + ID.
